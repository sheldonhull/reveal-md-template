# Why
I don't like powerpoints, and generally don't like reliance on Office. I prefer working with git, markdown, and provide ways to change the presentation without changing the content. This is my attempt to make reveal-md a bit of a better authorizing experience with less tags. I look to improve more helpers in the future, but for now, this will hopefully help someone get started if they want a little better start in authoring a presentation in markdown and presenting it with some nice polish.

## Helpers
I've updated a few behaviors to make markdown authoring of presentations better. I'm not a fan of having to mixup a lot of markup in markdown, I prefer it to be as clean as possible.
1. Seperator for slides is: `---------------------------------------------------------------------------------` instead of requiring more html commented tags like `<!-- foobar --->`
  "verticalSeparator": "^_____________________"

# Usage

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Command | Action                                |
|---------|---------------------------------------|
| s       | open speaker notes in seperate window |
